# Product Analytics A/B Testing — Onboarding Experiment

This project presents an end-to-end analysis of a randomized A/B test evaluating a new onboarding experience on a digital platform.
The objective of the experiment was to measure the impact of the new onboarding flow on:

   - Conversion to paid subscription
   - Early user engagement
   - Expected lifetime value (LTV)

## The analysis includes:

- Experiment design and setup
- Data cleaning and user-level aggregation
- Funnel and conversion analysis
- Estimation of treatment effects using statistical methods
- Evaluation of trade-offs between acquisition and retention
- Business impact assessment and recommendations
- Results show that while the new onboarding improved paid conversion, it reduced early post-payment engagement, highlighting a trade-off between short-term growth and long-term retention.
